# YAMB
**Y**et **A**nother **M**icro **B**log.

Heavily inspired by [WorstPress](https://github.com/surprisetalk/worstpress) which is written by Taylor Troesh. 

## Prerequisites
- Pandoc

## How to use?
 1. Write your Markdown blog entries in `entries` directory.
 2. Run `compile.sh` script.
 3. Serve `www` directory.

## Neat tricks

You can setup `cron` for running `compile.sh` and `rsync` commands which will generate HTMLs and copy them to a remote server periodically. Voil√†! You don't even have to think about the boring stuff. An example cron file is also provided.

## TODOs
- [x] The insertion of generated `HTML` files in templates is dependant on the line which we are trying to insert. This can be done without using `sed -i "50r ./tmp/archive.html" ./www/archive.html`. (done in [2241690](https://github.com/doneforaiur/yamb/commit/224169060c72eb4c1dcdc71039bd4424881cc035))
- [x] `Recent` section should include only 10 most recent entries. For now it's handled by checking the line count of the generated HTML, which is not ideal. (done in [7ec715a](https://github.com/doneforaiur/yamb/commit/7ec715a574498a704642172164d6ac3eae226766))
- [x] `Current` section includes entries based on `_` prefix of the Markdown file, also not good. (done in [fce9acc](https://github.com/doneforaiur/yamb/commit/fce9acca2fa2cbdce26c03b269a52d3e1208eec6))
- [x] Generate pages that are not shown as entries, but standalone articles. `books.html`, `podcasts.html`, etc.
- [x] `ls -t` and `stat` commands are not ideal since it sorts by modification time, not creation time. `--time=birth` is not available on *all* filesystems. Sorting the files based on the first line of the file which will include the desired date is a better solution. If date not present, take modification time. (done in [6ee1ec4](https://github.com/doneforaiur/yamb/commit/6ee1ec4f0ce08472acbaa94c506a6e2983ad4204))
- [x] Pages with not enough text to fill the full width of the `body` appear to be more narrow than the rest. (done in [6ee1ec4](https://github.com/doneforaiur/yamb/commit/6ee1ec4f0ce08472acbaa94c506a6e2983ad4204))
